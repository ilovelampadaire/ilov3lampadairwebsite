# ilovelampadairewebsiteofficial
As of 10/10/24, i have now archived this website until the domain ending date... I really enjoyed making this website as my fun project until when the organization account accident came in and now vercel asks me to pay a 10$ per months subscription, i just don't also feel like keeping this domain due to namecheap recently making the price from 10 to 30 or 40 dollars for the domain name, i am now switching to **hostinger** and this project will be used for when there is pull requests to then import the new files to my new hostinger domain/hoster. If you want the new website, its https://lampsprojects.net .
The homepage is just a basic ai generated homepage but i will soon add a new subdomain called: https://home.lampsprojects.net for storing the ai homepage and placing the old website on the main domain. I really didn't wanna do this but yeah, i will see you in a few months or days idk for an update prob.

See ya.
