<h1>The current website will soon get discontinued</h1>
<p>The website will be hosted on hostinger soon since namecheap is now making domains too expensive to keep up with their service + hostinger seems a good service, i also cannot make new subdomains without vercel saying to pay a subscription</p>
<p>The github repository that this website is hosted on will be used for me to download the updated files and upload them to hostinger's file manager for the domain.</p>
<a href="https://ilovelampadaire.com/index">Continue using the website</a>
